## 3. Installation Instructions
(Detailed guide to install program codes will be described here!)

example)

(1) See the "[climpred]" for detailed instructions

(2) It might be useful --but not at all required-- to use the provided iri-dev.yml conda environment file. If so, just follow the usual approach:
```sh
conda env create -f iri-dev.yml
```

## 4. Examples
(Detailed guide to run program codes will be described here!)

example)

```sh
MJODiagnostics(Parameter,...)
```
